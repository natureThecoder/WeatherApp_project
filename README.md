Weather App: Create a weather app that shows the current weather conditions in a particular location using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and API.
Steps:
Choose a weather API: There are many weather APIs available for free or for a fee. Some popular options include OpenWeatherMap, Dark Sky, and Weather Underground.
Preferably, select one without an API key. If you select one with an API key, once you have chosen a weather API, you will need to create an account and obtain an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the API.
Create the HTML structure: The HTML structure for a weather app should include an input field for the user to enter their location and a section to display the weather information.
Style the app with CSS: Use CSS to style the app and make it visually appealing.
Write JavaScript code to fetch the weather data from the API: Use JavaScript to send a request to the API using the user's location and API key. Then parse the response and display the weather information on the page.
Requirements:
HTML: The app should have a basic HTML structure with an input field for the user to enter their location and a section to display the weather information.
CSS: The app should be styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to use.
JavaScript: The app should use JavaScript to fetch weather data from the API, parse the response, and display the weather information on the page.
